A Ruby gem that lets you test for the presence of command line tools and ensure
that you have a version of the tool that you know how to work with.

It uses the gem system's version matching semantics so you can do things like
enforce a major version but allow any minor version above a certain value for a
tool. If you use Gemfile's the syntax should look pretty familiary to you.
